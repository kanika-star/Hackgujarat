{
	q:'A positively charged particle is released from rest in an uniform electric field. The electric potential energy of the charge',
	options:[' remains a constant because the electric field is uniform.','increases because the charge moves along the electric field.','decreases because the charge moves along the electric field.','decreases because the charge moves opposite to the electric field.'],
	answer:2
},
{
	q:'A hollow metal sphere of radius 5 cm is charged so that the potential on its surface is 10 V. The potential at the centre of the sphere is',
	options:['0 V','10 V','Same as at point 5 cm away from the surface','Same as at point 25 cm away from the surface'],
	answer:1

{
	q:'Which of the following options are correct? If a conductor has a potential V 4- 0 and there are no charges anywhere else outside, then',
	options:['there must not be charges on the surface or inside itself.','there cannot be any charge in the body of the conductor.','there must be charges only on the surface.','there must be charges inside the surface.'],
	answer:1
},
{
	q:'A capacitor is charged by using a battery which is then disconnected. A dielectric slab then slipped between the plates, which results in',
	options:[' reduction of charge on the plates and increase of potential difference across the plates.','increase in the potential difference across the plate, reduction in stored energy, but no change in the charge on the plates.','decrease in the potential difference across the plates, reduction in the stored energy, but no change in the charge on the plates.','none of these'],
	answer:2
},
{
	q:'A capacitor has some dielectric between its plates, and the capacitor is connected to a dc source. The battery is now disconnected and then the dielectric is removed, then',
	options:['capacitance will increase.','energy stored will decrease.','electric field will increase.','voltage will decrease.'],
	answer:2
